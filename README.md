Code written in Matlab with the article "Automated approach for source location in shallow waters", by A. Niclas

    Datas: 
- pekeris_model_tool.mat : Measured signal in the Pekeris model tool, generated by J. Bonnel (see more infos here: https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/147/3/1897/996362/Nonlinear-time-warping-made-simple-A-step-by-step)

- impulsive_source_gunshot.mat : Experimental data of a signal generated by an impulsive source gunshot (see more infos here: https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/141/5/3059/606227/Using-nonlinear-time-warping-to-estimate-North)

- combustive_sound_source.mat : Experimental data of a signal generated by an combustive sound source (see more infos here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29857724/)  

    Main programs:

- pekeris_model_tool.m : Run the automated procedure on the synthetical data in the Pekersi model tool. Plot each step of the separation method by warping, the approximated dispersion curves, the best fit and the associated parameters.

- impulsive_source_gunshot.m : Run the automated procedure on the experimental data generated by an impulsive source gunshot. Plot each step of the separation method by warping, the approximated dispersion curves, the best fit and the associated parameters.

- combustive_sound_source.m : Run the automated procedure on the experimental data generated by a combustive sound source. Optional: plot each step of the separation method by warping. Then, plot the approximated dispersion curves, the best fit and the associated parameters.
